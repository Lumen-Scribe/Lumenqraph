# Deep Historical Backfill

> **Issue #84** — Gapless Soroban event history beyond the ~7-day RPC retention
> window via a captive-core / data-lake source.

## Background

The Lumenqraph live poller and the built-in `backfill` subcommand both call
`getEvents` on a Soroban RPC. SDF's public RPC retains ~7 days (~120 000
ledgers) of event history, and `START_LEDGER` is clamped to that window.
Analytics, audits, and "since inception" dashboards need history older than
7 days — that requires an alternate ingest source.

## Archive RPC timeouts

If you are backfilling recent history (inside the ~7-day RPC window) with the
RPC-based `backfill` subcommand — usually via `scripts/backfill.sh` — against a
slow archive or paid RPC endpoint, raise the RPC timeout.

`RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS` defaults to `30`, which suits the public SDF RPC. Archive
endpoints answering deep `getEvents` queries are frequently slower than that. A
timeout aborts the entire batch, and the automatic retry reuses the same
timeout, so a consistently slow RPC turns into a permanent failure until the
value is raised. **120 seconds** is a good starting point for archive RPCs;
increase further if you still see timeouts.

Set it any of these ways (highest precedence first):

```bash
# 1. Per-run flag on the backfill script:
./scripts/backfill.sh --rpc-timeout 120 <start_ledger>

# 2. Exported in the environment:
RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS=120 ./scripts/backfill.sh <start_ledger>

# 3. Persisted in .env (picked up by the indexer, not overridden if already set):
echo 'RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS=120' >> .env
```

The data-lake `deep-backfill` path below does not talk to an RPC, so
`RPC_TIMEOUT_SECS` has no effect there.

## Architecture

```
Data lake export               deep-backfill           Postgres
(Galexie NDJSON)  ──parse──▶  HistoricalSource  ──insert──▶  events
                                                              token_transfers

 Soroban RPC      ──poll──▶   live poller        ──insert──▶  (same tables)
```

The two paths write to the same tables. `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on
`event_id` makes every write idempotent, so:

- Running both paths concurrently is safe.
- Restarting a backfill from an earlier ledger is safe.
- Overlapping the backfill range with the live poller's window is safe.

## Supported sources

| Source | Flag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Galexie / Stellar CDP | `--source galexie` | Newline-delimited JSON export |

New sources can be added by implementing the `HistoricalSource` trait in
`crates/lumenqraph-indexer/src/deep_backfill.rs`.

## Obtaining a Galexie export

[Galexie](https://github.com/stellar/galexie) is the Stellar Development
Foundation's data-lake exporter. It writes per-ledger JSON to GCS/S3. The
[Stellar Hubble / CDP pipeline](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-etl) can
also export events as newline-delimited JSON.

For a quick test export from a captive-core instance:

```bash
# Install galexie: https://github.com/stellar/galexie
galexie export \
  --start-ledger 1000000 \
  --end-ledger   5000000 \
  --output events.ndjson
```

## Running a deep backfill

```bash
# Build the indexer binary first:
cargo build --release -p lumenqraph-indexer

# Backfill from ledger 1 000 000 to 5 000 000 from a single file:
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… ./target/release/lumenqraph-indexer deep-backfill \
  --from   1000000    \
  --to     5000000    \
  --source galexie    \
  --input  /data/events.ndjson

# Multiple files (processed in order, must be in ascending ledger order):
./target/release/lumenqraph-indexer deep-backfill \
  --from 1000000 \
  --to   9000000 \
  --input /data/2023.ndjson \
  --input /data/2024.ndjson \
  --input /data/2025.ndjson

# From stdin (e.g. pipe from gsutil or S3):
gsutil cat gs://my-bucket/events-*.ndjson | \
  ./target/release/lumenqraph-indexer deep-backfill \
    --from 1000000 \
    --input -
```

## Seam / hand-off to the live poller

The live poller picks up from where its cursor left off. To ensure no gap
between the deep backfill and the live tail:

1. Run the deep backfill with `--to <overlap_ledger>` where `overlap_ledger`
   is a few thousand ledgers inside the RPC retention window (~100k ledgers
   from the current tip).
2. Start the live poller with `START_LEDGER=<overlap_ledger>` (or just let it
   start from the tip — it will catch up the small overlap window
   automatically).

Because inserts are idempotent, any events in the overlap zone are safely
de-duplicated.

```
Timeline:
  ←──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→
  genesis           overlap_ledger - 100k      overlap_ledger         tip
  |←─── deep backfill covers this range ────→|
                                    |←── live poller covers this →|
                                              ↑ overlap is safe
```

## Input format

### Galexie envelope (native)

```json
{
  "ledger": 1000000,
  "ledger_close_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "0001000000000000-000",
      "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
      "type": "contract",
      "topic": ["AAAADw==", "AAAAB3RyYW5zZmVy"],
      "value": "AAAACv//…",
      "tx_hash": "3664562a…",
      "in_successful_contract_call": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Flat per-event record

```json
{
  "id": "0001000000000000-000",
  "contract_id": "CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC",
  "ledger": 1000000,
  "ledger_closed_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "type": "contract",
  "topic": ["AAAADw=="],
  "value": "AAAACv//…",
  "tx_hash": "3664562a…",
  "in_successful_contract_call": true
}
```

Both formats are auto-detected per line (by the presence of the `"events"` key).

### Notes

- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.
- Empty lines are ignored.
- Unknown fields are ignored.
- `in_successful_contract_call` defaults to `true` when absent.
- `type` defaults to `"contract"` when absent.
- `paging_token` defaults to `id` when absent.

## Known limitations

- The deep backfill path doesn't fetch contract specs from RPC (RPC is not
  available in data-lake mode). Events are still decoded (XDR → JSON) but the
  `enriched` field (named/typed record from the on-chain spec) will be `null`
  for contracts whose specs weren't already loaded by the live poller.
  Run the live poller for at least one cycle before starting the deep backfill
  to warm the spec cache for tracked contracts, or run the deep backfill first
  and then allow the poller to enrich on next encounter.
- Large exports (millions of ledgers) may use significant memory during the
  collect phase. A future improvement will stream batches to Postgres.
- Compressed inputs (`.gz`) are not decompressed automatically — decompress
  first with `gzip -d` or pipe through `gunzip`.
