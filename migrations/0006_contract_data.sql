-- Per-key contract-data indexing: versioned snapshots of *individual*
-- persistent (or temporary) storage entries — a single ledger key/value pair
-- such as one token holder's `Balance(Address)`.
--
-- Unlike instance storage (see 0005), these entries are NOT enumerable from
-- RPC: you can only fetch an entry if you know its exact key. Lumenqraph
-- discovers the keys worth tracking from the events it already indexes (e.g. the
-- holders named in a token's `transfer`/`mint`/`burn` events) and snapshots each
-- one by key.
--
-- One row per (contract, key, ledger-at-which-the-entry-last-changed), so — like
-- contract_state — the table is a per-key time series: the newest row for a key
-- is its current value, older rows are history.
